### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Warsaw University of Technology. My field is computer science, but most of my work is somehow interdisciplinary as it overlaps with nuclear physics and electrical engineering.

I am currently working on cold plasma simulations with the Particle-in-Cell method coupled with Monte Carlo Collisions. As these are relatively computationally demanding, I also learn to parallelize them on GPUs. If you are an advanced GPU programmer, I would love some guidance!
